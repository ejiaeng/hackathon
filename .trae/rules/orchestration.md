Project Orchestration Rules
Tech Stack: Next.js (Frontend), Capacitor (android), Spring Boot (Java Backend).

Communication: All frontend-to-backend calls must use the Windows local IP (not localhost).

Permissions: Always include NSCameraUsageDescription and NSMicrophoneUsageDescription when generating iOS-related files.

Code Style: Use TypeScript for Frontend and Java 17+ for Backend.
